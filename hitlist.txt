- create a new poll with a name of my choice
- edit the poll.
- The link should be difficult to guess.
- As a poll maker, I should get a link to give out to people to take the poll

# edit page will be a poll dashboard
  # show the secret poll edit link and the secret poll submission page as well
  # as any statistics ,etc

  Create a action in polls controller
  Create a route that routes to that action
  Figure out how to get form_for to submit to that route that you created

  <% @poll.questions.each do |q| %>
    <tr>
    <td>Question Body</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    </tr>
    <input name="poll[questions][<%= q.id %>][boddfdfy]" value="<%= q.body %>">

    <%= text_field_tag :body, "hi", :name => "poll[questions][#{q.id}][body]" %>

  <% end %>
